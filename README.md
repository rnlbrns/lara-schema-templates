# lara-schema-templates

Sometimes, when working on something new and you don't have anyschema, you have to write dozens of line for repetitive columns on different tables (e.g. you're going to use _first_name_ and _last_name_ columns for multiple tables, so what I did is create different classes and modify the **Blueprint** object based on the type (Basic, Person, Files, etc).

ToDo:
 - move this to vendor
